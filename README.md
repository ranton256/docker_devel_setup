# Docker Devel Setup

Local Docker setup for developing in Ubuntu

This repo contains a Dockerfile and a couple scripts to build and use a Docker container suitable for local development.

It is setup for gcc, make, and git, but you can update the Dockerfile to add whatever other packages you would find useful.
